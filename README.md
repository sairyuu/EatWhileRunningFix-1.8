# EatWhileRunningFix-1.8
In progress... // This is a common issue that bothers practice pvp servers, TDLR, the player is able to run and eat with this glitch. I've managed to find a fix for that about a year ago for PotPvP Brazil (which is in STAND-BY now), since there will be no more new projects coming from me, I thought that it would be good if I open source my code just so everyone could fix it in their own servers.
